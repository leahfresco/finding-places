####Geo-located to your current location
Map is set to default to San Francisco but if user accepts to share location with the browser then the map will center to the user's location and use that location in the search.


####Search for anything
Type anything from a specific address to "restaurants" or "nail salon" to find places within the map zone.

## <a name="tech"></a>Technologies
This single page application is build with React/Redux, Bootstrap and CSS. ReactJS is a front end framework that allows for interactive UIs in which components on the page are modular. Redux allows a central place for data to be stored so that it can flow through components as needed.

## <a name="about"></a>About Me
My name is Leah Yukelson and I am located in San Francisco, CA. I studied business information systems at Cal Poly SLO with an emphasis in computer science. After graduation, I went to work at Macy's doing search marketing; managing multi-million dollar budgets and making strategic marketing choices. While being on the business-facing side of advertising, I became more interested in how the technology works. I loved the logic problem solving aspect of my computer science classes at Cal Poly and decided to dive back into programming by self studying Python and then attending Hackbright Academy. Since Hackbright, Iâ€™ve taken on learning new frameworks such as Django, Node and React - building smaller projects with these technologies. I find the endless amount of learning to be done in programming to be an exciting perk of the field.
